                "Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communication is based on an open medium; thus, a legitimate signal can potentially be counterfeited by a malicious signal. Although most LTE signaling messages are protected from modification using cryptographic primitives, broadcast messages in LTE have never been integrity protected. In this paper, for the first time, we present a signal injection attack that exploits the fundamental weaknesses of broadcast messages in LTE and modifies a transmitted signal over the air. This attack, which is referred to as signal overshadowing (named SigOver) has several advantages and differences when compared with existing attacks using a fake base station. For example, with a 3 dB power difference from a legitimate signal, the SigOver attack demonstrated a 98% success rate when compared with the 80% success rate of attacks achieved using a fake base station, even with a 35 dB power difference. Given that the SigOver attack is a novel primitive attack, it yields five new attack scenarios and implications. Finally, a discussion on two potential countermeasures leaves practical and robust defense mechanism as a future work."

            "content": [
                "Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology utilizes broadcast signals to transmit essential information from a cellular network to user devices. At minimum, the information broadcasted by an LTE base station, which is referred to as an evolved NodeB (eNB), includes the synchronization information and radio resource configurations required for a User Equipment (UE) to access the cellular network. Based on the received broadcast signals, a UE registers with the network by performing an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure. After registration, the UE monitors the broadcast signals for various objectives. For example, when the UE does not have a connection with an eNB due to its inactivity, it needs to listen to paging messages regularly to check the messages transmitted to it.Even when the UE has an active connection with an eNB, the UE keeps listening broadcast signals to determine potential changes in system-wide radio configurations which are required to be updated, and to identify the arrival of messages intended to multiple UEs.",
                "Despite its various practical applications, the broadcast signal is not security-protected at all. In LTE, communication between a UE and network is secured only after successful authentication and security handshake procedures, namely Non-Access Stratum (NAS) and Access Stratum (AS) security mode procedures for the protection of unicast messages. Unprotected broadcast signals may be unavoidable to a certain extent in wireless communication; however, they subject the system and UEs to various vulnerabilities that can be exploited.",
                "Previous studies [21, 26, 36, 39, 40] reported on several attacks that exploit unprotected broadcast signals. In general, such attacks employ a fake base station (FBS) that attracts UEs to be connected to itself by transmitting a signal stronger than those of the legitimate base stations. The attacks mainly exploit the paging messages, resulting in undesirable effects on the UE, e.g., out-of-service and battery drains. Notably, such FBS-based attacks entail noticeable characteristics (e.g., high signal power) and/or outcomes (e.g., service denial) that enable the victim UEs to identify the presence of the FBS (see Section 3.5 for details).",
                "In this paper, we propose a new approach referred to as the SigOver attack, which injects a manipulated broadcast signal into UEs without employing an FBS. The SigOver attack overwrites a portion of the legitimate signal using the manipulated attack signal. The SigOver attack is based on the fact that the UE decodes a stronger signal when it concurrently receives multiple overlapping signals, which is referred to as the capture effect [51]. The main technical component of the attack is to synchronize the timing of the attack signal with that of the targeted legitimate signal so that the UE only decodes the attack signal (see Section 3). This attack is both stealthy and far-reaching. It is stealthy because the attack signal, which is transmitted at a significantly low power level, only overshadows the targeted signal; whereas the other signals/messages between the victim UEs and network remain intact. It is farreaching because the attack signal can simultaneously affect a large number of nearby UEs with low signaling and a low computational cost. Note that the SigOver attack does not require any active communication with the UEs, and it does not relay messages between UEs and an eNB.",
                "The SigOver attack is the first practical realization of the signal overshadowing attack on the LTE broadcast signals using a low-cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and open source LTE library [43]. The SigOver attack was made practical by addressing the following challenge: time and frequency synchronization. To overshadow the legitimate signal using the malicious signal, the SigOver attack needs to be tightly time-synchronized with the eNB’s downlink physical channel to which the victim UE is listening. To achieve time synchronization, we leverage the synchronization signals of the eNB that are transmitted periodically with a fixed time gap. For accurate frequency synchronization, we employ a Global Positioning System (GPS) disciplined oscillator.",
                "The feasibility of the SigOver attack was verified by testing it against 10 smartphones (listed in Section 5) connected to an operational network1. For the experiments, we introduced five new attack scenarios, which included the signaling storm, denial of service (DoS) against UEs, network downgrade, and UE location tracking (Section 5). The experimental results reveal that the SigOver attack overshadows the target signal and causes the victim device to decode it with a 98% success rate and a power difference of only 3 dB from a legitimate signal. On the other hand, attacks utilizing an FBS have only 80% success rate even with a 35 dB power difference. This implies that the SigOver attack is significantly more efficient than the attacks using the FBS.",
                "Finally, two potential countermeasures against the SigOver attack are discussed in Section 6: (1) digital signature based solution and (2) channel estimation based detection. Moreover, a practical and robust solution to the SigOver attack is left as a future work.",

Thereafter, the UE obtains time synchronization on a subframe basis and the PCI of the cell by listening to a Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) and a Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS).

If the UE receives the paging message, it sends a RRC connection request and a Service request message to the LTE network. Paging is also used to notify the system information change or provide emergency alerts such as the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS) and Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS). The UE also reads the SIB1 to identify the current TA. If the UE enters into a new TA that is not in the TAI list, the UE sends a Tracking Area Update (TAU) request to the MME to report its location. In addition, the UE periodically measures the power and quality of the serving cell and neighboring cells by calculating the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ). When the RSRP of a neighboring cell is higher than that of the serving cell by a certain threshold, the UE selects new cell and camps on it (i.e., cell re-selection)."

However, as the victim key is unavailable, the encrypted messages cannot be decrypted. Note that (ii) is trivially achievable because messages are transmitted through the open medium. Under the above assumptions, we show that an active adversary can inject malicious messages into the victim UE(s) by overwriting the legitimate messages.

Each subframe is encoded separately by the base station, and is therefore decoded accordingly by the UE. Under this frame structure, Figure 3 conceptually illustrates the SigOver attack, where the attacker injects a crafted subframe (brown color) that precisely overshadows the legitimate subframe (blue color). Since the subframes are decoded independently from one another, the legitimate (non-overshadowed) subframes are generally not affected. At the same time, the injected subframe is crafted such that the UEs that have received and decoded the subframe behave based on the included information, which typically yields an abnormal or malicious behavior - an intended behavior by the attacker. The inherent vulnerability of LTE broadcast messages enables an attacker to launch various types of attacks using legitimately-looking messages (i.e., insidiously).",

Two technical challenges to launch the SigOver attack are (i) carefully crafting the overshadowing message to be decoded by the victim UEs (Section 3.3), and (ii) the stringent requirement of the transmission timing and frequency for precise overshadowing (Section 3.4)."

Therefore, to inject a subframe, the attacker needs to craft a subframe that contains the PCFICH, PDSCH and PDSCH. However, the injected subframe containing those values may not be decoded correctly at the UE due to a channel estimation error. Note that the UE estimates the channel from the RS transmitted by the legitimate eNB, yet the estimation result may be inappropriate to decode the injected subframe correctly. To address this issue, the RS is included in the subframe for the SigOver attack, which significantly increases the robustness of the SigOver attack.",
                "The last technical challenge related to the decoding of the crafted subframe is with respect to wireless channel estimation and equalization, for recovery from the signal distortion due to the channel. In the SigOver attack, the channel is estimated either dominantly (even solely depending on the paging occasion) from the crafted subframe (RRC Idle), or it is averaged from consecutive subframes (RRC Connected) along with multiple legitimate subframes. In the former, a single injection is sufficient for the attack (i.e., decoding of the crafted subframe). In the latter, repeated injections are needed to effectively reflect the wireless channel between the attacker and the victim UE. According to our measurement (Section 4) which injected one subframe for every SFN, SigOver attack reaches over 98% success rate in less than a second while maintaining reliable communication for legitimate subframes. In Appendix A, we present empirical results showing that legitimate communication is minimally affected by SigOver attack using several services including web browsing and streaming."

                "As shown in Figure 5, however, the crafted subframe transmitted at the acquired subframe timing may still arrive at the UE with a slight timing offset (with reference to the legitimate subframe) due to the propagation delay. Although the delay (d) is unavoidable (as the propagation delay is immeasurable by the attacker), its impact is minimal. This is because the baseband processor in the UE is designed to compensate the delay due to mobility and environmental effects [48]. Since the maximum delay that can be compensated is dependent on the baseband processor of the UE, we perform the following experiments to measure the delay. We assumed the typical three-sector cell configuration wherein the transmission angle of the cell is 120◦ [10]. The delay (d) is maximized when the attacker and the victim UE are located at both ends of the arc. This translates to d = 8.66μs under a typical cell radius of approximately 1.5km in urban environments. We measured the offset tolerance on two devices with different basebands (Qualcomm and Exynos), and the tolerance was larger than the maximum delay (i.e., 8.66μs) (see Section 4 for detailed experimental results).",
                "Frequency synchronization. The operating frequency of a radio device is determined by the oscillator, where it inevitably suffers from a device-specific offset that is randomly imposed during manufacturing and generated during operation due to environmental effects (e.g., temperature). Such an imperfection in the oscillator is reflected in the radio signal as carrier frequency offset. In LTE, there are a number of readily available techniques [27, 50] to compensate for offsets up to a certain level (e.g., Up to ±7.5KHz for PSS based compensation in the LTE 15KHz subcarrier spacing [38]). Therefore, for the reliable implementation of the SigOver attack, the offset should be maintained below that level in the UE, at all times.",
                "The LTE standard defines the minimum frequency accuTo satisfy the requirement, eNBs are equipped with highly accurate oscillators and further augmentation techniques such as a precision time protocol and GPS. In contrast, the SigOver attack was run on a typical, inexpensive SDR with an inaccurate oscillator (±2500 ppb for the USRP X310 [16]). A GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) was employed, namely, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) to reduce the frequency offset to an appropriate level. The GPSDO provides a sufficient accuracy of ±25 ppb [14, 32] and is highly stable (±1 ppb when the GPS locked). This indicates a frequency offset of up to ±270Hz (at 3.6GHz with an offset of 75 ppb), within the LTE FDD frequency range of 460MHz-3.6GHz [6]. Our experiment confirms that all 10 devices (listed in Section 5) can compensate such small frequency offset to enable a reliable SigOver attack."

In an FBS attack, the attacker (i.e., the FBS) attracts victim UEs to camp on itself by transmitting a stronger signal than legitimate cells. The attacker then injects unprotected yet legitimate-looking messages to the victim UE. The FBS attack has the following limitations when compared with the SigOver attack.",

However, it has not been well investigated how much stronger signal the FBS should transmit than a legitimate base station to attract nearby victim UEs. This is an important question to be answered for the attacker, as higher power increases the chance of attracting the UE at a greater risk of being detected through power measurements (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ). According to the experimental measurements, the FBS attack reaches 100% success at 40 dB, whereas the SigOver attack was 98% successful at 3 dB (see Table 2). In particular, the FBS requires a power consumption greater than that of the SigOver attack by a factor of 5000, to achieve a comparable attack success rate.",

                "Stealthiness. In general, an FBS is configured to masquerade as a legitimate base station as presented in previous studies [21, 22, 39, 40]. For example, the FBS broadcasts the same MIB and SIB1/2 messages as those of the legitimate cell and may use the same PCI to make itself indistinguishable from the legitimate ones. Nevertheless, the FBS inevitably carries several unique and clear signatures for detection [25, 30, 33, 49, 53]. First, as discussed earlier, an FBS attack uses ×10,000 stronger power (cf. ×2 for SigOver attack) than a legitimate cell, which is a clear indicator of the FBS. Second, when an FBS attracts a victim UE camping on a legitimate cell, the victim must undergo a cell re-selection process, where the victim UE reads the MIB and SIB1/2 messages from the FBS (Figure 6a). Third, the operation of the FBS may be very different from the legitimate ones due to its limited physical capabilities compared to the real base station3. Such operational characteristics include a relatively low paging rate, in addition to different RF properties such as a large frequency offset due to the low cost hardware. Finally, the FBS cannot establish a secure connection with the UE or transport protected NAS messages between the UE and the network (i.e., MME), which results in a denial of service to the UE. Hence, it is highly probable that a UE is able to detect an FBS. On the other hand, the mechanism of the SigOver attack is to precisely overshadow a specific broadcast message without interfering the synchronization between the victim UE and current cell. Therefore, as shown in Figure 6b, the UE does not carry out cell re-selection or reconfigure any cellspecific parameters. The UE subject to the SigOver attack maintains secure signaling connections with the legitimate eNB and MME.",
                "Sustainability. If a victim UE camps on an FBS, it cannot receive the service via the FBS. This can be used by the UE as a potential FBS detection mechanism as mentioned above. To avoid such detection, the FBS may take the following strategy: it injects a malicious message to the UE, and releases a connection (e.g., by causing a radio link failure or triggering cell re-selection at the UE) so that the victim UE returns to a legitimate cell. Under this scenario, however, the injected message should be selected such that the attack sustains even if the UE makes a cell change (e.g., TAU Reject [39]) or has an immediate impact on the UE (e.g., emergency warning message [21]). Thus, it is not an appropriate attack vector to exploit broadcast messages (e.g., SIB messages) that are refreshed when the serving cell changes. This makes the FBS attack either limited in terms of attack scope (as exploitable messages are very limited) or less sustainable in its duration."

            "content": [
                "Recently, a new type of FBS attack referred to as the aLTEr [37] attack was discovered. This is an MitM attack that employs an FBS with eNB and UE capabilities. The eNB component of the FBS impersonates a legitimate eNB by relaying the messages from the eNB to a victim UE. In addition, the UE component of the FBS impersonates the victim UE by relaying the messages from the UE to the eNB. By sitting between the victim UE and the eNB, the MitM attacker manipulates user plane messages since the messages are not integrity-protected in LTE. The MitM attack inherits two aforementioned limitations of the FBS attack, namely, a high power consumption and low stealthiness, since the MitM attacker should attract the victim UEs in the same manner. Meanwhile, in principle, the MitM attack does not affect the connection between the victim UE and the eNB, thereby making the attack sustainable. However, we noticed that it is non-trivial to implement an MitM attacker for various reasons. First, to maintain the connection with a victim UE, the MitM attacker should relay all uplink and downlink messages exchanged between the victim UE and the eNB. To this end, the attacker must know the UE’s radio resource settings configured by the eNB and configure the radio resource for the UE accordingly. Otherwise, the radio connection between the UE and the eNB may become unstable or fail. However, since the message that contains the radio resource setting (i.e., RRC reconfiguration) is encrypted, the attacker cannot properly configure the UE’s radio resource. We note that the RRC reconfiguration contains a large number of PHY, MAC, RLC, and PDCP configurations for the UE.",
                "To address this issue, the aLTEr attack used the radio configuration in a heuristic manner under the following conditions: (i) a victim UE receives the service using the default radio configuration, and (ii) the default radio configuration of an operator is stable. That is, only a few parameters (e.g., scheduling request (SR) and channel quality indicator (CQI) configuration) are changed for each radio configuration; whereas the others are the same. Thus, the attacker only needs to guess the CQI and SR configurations. However, in the real world, the eNB frequently changes the UE’s radio configuration depending on the service that the UE is using and/or the current channel condition (e.g., initiating carrier aggregation, starting a Voice/Video call service, service priority, or channel quality change due to mobility). We observed that when a UE watched a YouTube video for 2 minutes under a bad chanFigure 7: Experiments are conducted at two UE locations, A and B:",

Note that, as the attacker is only able to know the message length and the sequence of message delivery, it may not correctly guess the configuration. We also observed that 8 out of 9 messages have different CQI configurations which also need to be guessed.",
                "These limitations apply to all MitM attacks, even when the attacker attempts to manipulate the broadcast message. However, the SigOver attack does not suffer from such limitations, as it only utilizes a persistent radio configuration acquired from the MIB of the legitimate cell (see Section 3.3)."

                "Implementation details. An attacker acquires the information of the target benign cell (PCI, MIB) using pdsch_ue or diagnostic tools [8, 42]. She acquires time synchronization with the target cell (mimicking the procedure for a benign UE to camp on a cell by getting the PSS/SSS and MIB). After she obtains the arrival timing and SFN information of the LTE frame transmitted by the benign cell, she transmits the malicious message to the target SFN. Thereafter, she continuously receives the PSS/SSS (every 5ms) and MIB (every 10ms) transmitted by the benign cell and updates the synchronization information. Self-interference may cause synchronization problems, because Rx and Tx are in the same frequency. However, due to the precise overshadowing, the SigOver attack can minimize the effects on the legitimate PSS/SSS and MIB (there was no case of losing synchronization due to the self-interference).",
                "As a minor issue, the USRP X310 generated an unintended high peak signal at the beginning and end of the signal when carrying out a burst transmission which SigOver attack does. This is due to the state change of the front-end components of the SDR. When there was no transmission, it was in the idle state. When transmission occurred, the transition to the transmitting state caused unwanted noise. We resolve this problem by simply padding zero to the front and back ends of the signal to separate the unwanted noise from the original signal, and by compensating the delay due to the zero padding during transmission.",
                "Ethical considerations. As the attacker, we use a downwardfacing dome-shaped antenna to minimize upward interference. In addition, we perform the experiments on the first basement level, which is the lowermost floor of the building. The basement floor was restricted during the experiments to prevent normal users from receiving the crafted signal. The experimental results with respect to the impact of the crafted signal revealed that the users upstairs and outside the building normally communicate with the legitimate base station without being affected by the signal.

                "Attack robustness. Table 3 summarizes the success rates of the SigOver attack for different combinations of experimental settings (LOS/NLOS) and RRC states (Idle/Connected). Each measurement was an average of 120 injected paging messages. In the RRC Idle state, we inject a paging message at the exact paging occasion (e.g., Subframe 9) and paging frame (e.g., SFN%256 = 144) of the victim UE. As discussed in Section 3.3, in the RRC Idle state, the channel estimation is carried out solely on the injected signal; whereas in the RRC Connected state, the average of the channel estimated from a set of the injected and legitimate signals is considered. In other words, in the RRC Idle state, injected signals are individually decoded without the impact of the legitimate signals; thus successful attacks (i.e., correct decoding) can be achieved with a single injection. However, in the RRC Connected state, repeated injection is required to overcome the influence of the legitimate signals. To achieve this, we inject a paging message at the exact paging occasion/frame of the victim UE. Simultaneously, we also inject a subframe with RS at every SFN, to reflect the channel of the injected signal and enable a successful attack. As shown in Table 3, the SigOver attack maintained a success rate greater than 97% in different RRC states and the LOS and NLOS setups, thus validating the robustness of the SigOver attack with respect to operating modes and environmental factors (e.g., multipath). Finally, during the experiments the victim UE neither reported any radio link failures nor initiated radio connection re-establishment (i.e., RRC Reestablishment request). This implies that the SigOver attack is non-disruptive to the victim UE and its service. Furthermore, we verify that the SigOver attack maintains 100% success rate for over 100 SIB 1 and SIB 2 messages in the RRC Idle state and LOS setup.",
                "Attack coverage. As described in Section 3.4, a crafted subframe may arrive at victim UE with a slight timing offset due to the propagation delay of the injected signal from the attacker to the victim UE. The decoding of the crafted subframe requires the offset to be bounded within the tolerance range of the UE LTE chipset. Hence, the largest tolerable offset determines the maximum propagation delay; or equivalently, the maximum distance between the attacker and the UE (i.e., the attack coverage). The attack coverage was experimentally evaluated, wherein the propagation delay between the attacker and the UE was emulated by time-shifting the transmission timings of the crafted subframes. We gradually changed the shift in the unit of 10 samples (=0.33μs at 30.72Msps), until the crafted subframes were not decoded; which indicates the maximum delay tolerance. Table 4 presents the tolerance measured from two smartphones with different basebands – LG G7 (Qualcomm), and Galaxy S9 (Exynos). The tolerance offset was consistently higher than 8.66μs across all the devices. With reference to the tolerance-distance relationship discussed in Section 3.4, the results indicate that the SigOver attack can cover the entire urban cell (typical radius of 1.5 km) at all times, irrespective of the relative positions of the UE and attacker."

The attacker first overshadows a paging message with the system_Info_Modification field set as true, thus forcing the UEs to read SIB1. The SIB1 is then overshadowed using a spoofed TAC, thus leading to the TAU. It should be noted that the TAU request messages are directed to the legitimate eNB, because the SigOver attack preserves the radio connection between the victim and the legitimate eNB.

Figure 9 reveals that a single UE carries out an average of seven TAU procedures per second, which is unlikely under the normal conditions without the attack. Moreover, the UE-side signaling messages were analyzed to better understand the behavior of the network under the attack. When the victim UE carries out the TAU with the spoofed TAC (irrespective of the validity of the TAC value), the network returns the same list of TACs previously provided during the legitimate registration. This is because the serving cell is unchanged. That is, the list of TACs still does not include the victim UE’s spoofed TAC. Hence, the victim UE repetitively carries out the TAU upon receiving the SIB1 message from the attacker. Nokia reports [31] that a UE generates approximately 45 service requests7 during a peak busy hour.

In particular, the UE continued to perform the TAU procedure, even after the attacker stopped injecting SIB18. The malfunctioning UE exhibits a normal behavior to the user, which indicates that the data/call service can be used without disrupting the user.

Upon the successful SigOver attack (i.e., injected paging and SIB2 are received); entire data services, which include web browsing and video streaming were blocked on all 10 devices. From the analysis of the device logs, it was found that all the devices failed to initiate any connection when applications made multiple connection requests. This confirms the feasibility of the barring via the SigOver attack. Moreover, the service-specific DoS was validated using the Samsung Galaxy S9 based on the Exynos chipset.",
                "Comparison with the FBS. An FBS can also inject malicious SIB2. However, the attack is only valid when the FBS is turned on, and immediately stops when the FBS is turned off. This is because the victim UE connects to the legitimate cell shortly after disconnection from the FBS. During the connection to the legitimate cell, the victim UE reads the legitimate SIB2, which recovers UE services. Conversely, the services of the victim UE remain blocked after SigOver attack stops, as this does not incur cell reselection. Furthermore, the FBS cannot achieve the service-selective DoS, as it cannot provide the LTE service."

As defined in the 3GPP standards, upon receiving the paging that contains the IMSI, the UE terminates all service sessions and initiates the registration procedure using the IMSI as the identifier [5]. This implies that the DoS attack can be realized by injecting the paging message with IMSI10. Specifically, the attacker injects a paging message that contains the IMSI of the victim UE at the paging occasion/frame of the victim UE. This attack detaches a UE from the cellular network services, which include voice call and data services, thus indicating a DoS at the UE. As the registration procedure (which follows the service termination) automatically recovers the services, the attack is sustained by the repeated injection of the paging message.",
                "Validation. This attack was validated using 10 different smartphone models in two different operation states (RRC Idle and RRC Connected). Specifically, in the RRC Idle state, we confirmed that the UEs successfully received the overshadowed paging message. Furthermore, the internal logs in the UEs confirmed the expected impact of the attack, i.e., detachment from the network followed by the registration procedure, thus leading to DoS.",

Note that the SigOver attack enables the attacker to convey the crafted message to the UE on the existing radio connection between the UE and the eNB. We first make a voice call on the victim UE to force the UE to enter the RRC Connected state. We then transmitted the paging message with IMSI to the UE. Interestingly, we observed that not all UEs handled the paging messages in the RRC Connected state. In particular, the Samsung Galaxy S8/S9, LG G6/G7 (Qualcomm), Samsung Galaxy S8/S9 (Exynos), and Apple iPhone XS (Intel) properly handled the paging message with IMSI, after which the call was immediately aborted (service termination). Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S6 (Exynos), and Galaxy S4, LG G2 (Qualcomm) did not respond to the attack in the RRC Connected state.",
                "The inconsistencies between the devices stem from the ambiguity of the 3GPP standards. The mechanism used to handle paging in the RRC Connected state is loosely defined, without specific direction on paging with IMSI, e.g., only information on paging with the system information notification or CMAS/ETWS [3] is provided. In summary, by injecting the paging message with IMSI , the SigOver attack can realize a DoS on the victim UE in RRC Idle and RRC Connected states, depending on the device.",

Although the impact and the attack vectors are equivalent, the applicability of the existing attacks is limited when compared with the SigOver attack. This is because the SigOver attack uniquely enables the attacker to deliver the paging message to the UE which has an active radio connection with the network, whereas other works are only applicable to UEs that use no services; thus indicating the wider applicability of the SigOver attack."

Upon the reception of the CS paging, the UE initiates the Circuit Switched Fall-Back process and transits to the 3G network. That is, the SigOver attack enables the attacker to force the UE to a slower connection.",

We experimentally confirmed that the victim UE in the RRC Idle state immediately switched to the 3G network when the attacker’s CS paging was received, after which it soon reverted back to the LTE network because there was no actual service in the 3G network. The attack was effective for the state-of-the-art smartphones, e.g., the Samsung Galaxy S8/S9, LG G6/G7 (Qualcomm), and Samsung Galaxy S8/S9 (Exynos), as they were able to respond the CS paging message the both RRC Idle and RRC Connected states. However, similar to the paging attack with IMSI, some smartphones did not respond to the CS paging in the RRC Connected state, and were therefore immune to the attack. Interestingly, when the Samsung Galaxy S8 (Qualcomm) dropped to the 3G network due to the attack, the LTE connection was never restored while using data service.",

However, in this study, the network was driven to send the paging message on behalf of the attacker, by establishing a call with the UE in the 3G network. It should be noted that, in the SigOver attack, the paging message is directly transmitted by the attacker. This attack inherently exposes the attacker’s phone number, thus making the attack easily detectable by the operator. In comparison, the SigOver attack silently transmits the CS paging to the victim UE. Furthermore, the existing work cannot downgrade the victim UEs in the RRC Connected state to the 3G network, since the network does not send a paging message to the victim UE in the RRC Connected state; whereas the SigOver attack can deliver the paging message."

As explained in Section 2, following the completion of the RA procedure, the UE attempts to establish an RRC connection by sending a Connection request (containing UE identity) to the cell. If the UE holds the previously assigned temporary identity (i.e., S-TMSI), this identity is included in the Connection request as well. Otherwise, a random value is selected. Upon the receipt of the UE’s request, the cell replies with the Connection setup that contains the UE’s identity (the S-TMSI or the random value). By checking this identity, each UE is able to recognize if its RA procedure was successful. If the procedure fails, the UE retries the RA procedure. The abovementioned procedure used to resolve connection conflicts is referred to as a contention resolution.",

First, the attacker with the knowledge of the S-TMSI of the victim UE injects a paging message with the S-TMSI11. The attacker then eavesdrops on the Connection setup messages transmitted from the legitimate cell12. When the Connection setup message that contains the S-TMSI of the victim UE is received, the attacker confirms that the victim UE resides within the coverage of the cell by sniffing the downlink messages.",

However, the FBS requires an active connection to the target victim to transmit the message. Therefore, the attack is limited by the FBS with respect to its stealthiness and power efficiency. In a previous study, it was reported that RNTI-TMSI mapping can be applied to passively monitor the victim’s TMSI [37]; however, the SigOver attack provides an active method by which the victim can be located."

For this, each base station needs to have a certificate issued by its operator and a UE needs to be provisioned with a root certificate (e.g., self-signed one by the operator) to verify the certificate of the base station. However, this natural defense has at least several deployment and technical challenges.",
                "Deployment challenges: In 5G, the 3GPP introduced a public key encryption for IMSI in the initial registration, to provide privacy protection for the permanent identifier. For this, each UE is provisioned with its home operator public key, thereby it was assumed that a public key provisioning mechanism to the UE is in place. This provisioning mechanism could also be used to provision a public key (or a signing certificate) for base station certificate verification. However, in roaming scenarios, the UE need to acquire the public key of the visited network operator, which is trusted by the home operator. This essentially requires a PKI for the global cellular networks that span the world and non-trivial trust relationships among multiple operators in different jurisdictions. Furthermore, managing certificate revocation lists are another obvious burden.",
                "Technical challenges: Signing every single broadcast message may incur a substantial computational overhead at the base station, considering the low periodicity of essential broadcast messages such as MIB (40ms) and SIB1/2 (80ms). Furthermore, message size increases due to the signature and certificate broadcasting (e.g., using a new SIB) would result in a higher power consumption at the base station. Similarly, from UE’s perspective, verifying certificate and signature would require additional power consumption, resulting in a faster battery drain. Such a power consumption may be prohibitive to low-power Internet of Things devices that need to survive many years without battery replacements.",

This is referred to as the channel diversity, and it is highly applicable to the attacker and victim UE, which are expected to be at different locations – i.e., the wireless channel between the attacker and UE is likely to be disparate from that between the eNB and UE. Therefore, the injection of the attack signal, which reflects the channel between the attacker and UE, naturally forces the channel information recovered at the UE to deviate from when only the legitimate subframes are present (without attack). In other words, the detection of such a variance in the channel could serve as a defense technique.",
                "The wireless channel can be conventionally represented as H [46] in complex representation. The magnitude |H| uniquely defines different wireless channels depending on how efficiently the signal power is delivered. Hence, an abrupt change in |H| is an effective metric to detect SigOver attack.",

In particular, the general application of the technique to various scenarios is not trivial, due to the various factors that have a potential influence on H. Figure 11b shows a detection failure example in NLOS setup, when the power of the injected signal was low. That is, the impact of the attack signal to H gradually fades out as the energy decreases, down to the point where it is difficult to detect. Figure 11c clearly demonstrates this challenge, wherein the drop in the correlation was fuzzy in NLOS setup, unlike in the LOS setup (strong injection signal).

The effects of the SigOver attack would be broader and more damaging if the cellular network is utilized for critical domains, e.g., vehicular networks and industrial systems. Therefore, in principle, the intrinsic broadcast vulnerabilities of the cellular system should be addressed. Meanwhile, it is recommended that critical services should have their own security protection instead of relying on those of other protocol layers. For example, the issue of the ETWS or CMAS may be better addressed at the application level13, instead of being based on SIB protection, since the SIB is only a transport mechanism for those critical application messages."

The signal overshadowing attack, which exploits the use of an open medium and the capture effect, has been widely conducted in the wireless systems such as GPS [20, 45] and Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs) [52]. Pöpper et al. presented a symbol flipping attack on the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel [34], with a fine-grained overshadowing of the signal at the symbol level. However, it requires exact information with respect to the timing, amplitude, and phase, which is difficult to achieve in the real world. Similar to this study, Wilhelm et al. demonstrated the possibility of signal overshadowing and its impact on IEEE 802.15.4 [52]. In comparison, the SigOver attack is the first comprehensive study in which the signal overshadowing attack on the LTE was realized, in addition to the validation of its practicability.

First, the SigOver attack silently injects the victim with malicious messages while making the victim keep being synchronized with the legitimated eNB. As a result, during the SigOver attack, the uplink response message of the victim naturally goes to the legitimated eNB. However, the victim UE in LTEInspector transmitted its uplink response message to the malicious eNB after receiving the manipulated message, which is the general response action for the attack with the FBS. Thus, it is more similar to existing attacks using FBS. Second, the SigOver attack overwrites the target signal with malicious signals without requiring a connection to the malicious base station. To this end, we investigate various requirements of the SigOver attack as described in Section 3. Despite other requirements, LTEInspector only considered the paging cycle and its occasion, which are the part of timing synchronization requirements.",

                "We measure the impact of the quality of services under the SigOver attack, where the malicious paging messages are transmitted at the every subframe 9. This implies that legitimate subframes at subframe 9 are overshadowed and lost, whereas non-overshadowed legitimate subframes may also be affected by crafted subframes. Specifically, the RS of the crafted subframes perturbs the channel estimation averaged among crafted and non-overshadowed legitimate subframes (in RRC Connected state), which may disturb the equalization and incur errors. Despite such factors, the impact of SigOver attack is validated to kept minimal, as demonstrated in this section under a range of common, but distinct services of voice call, web surfing, FTP download, and live streaming. We note that measurements were carried out under a reliable SigOver attack (>97% success rate) for the UE in the RRC Connected state.",

                "Voice call. The UEs camping on LTE network use Voice over LTE (VoLTE) as a call service. We evaluate the impact of the SigOver attack on the key factors with respect to the VoLTE performance [13]; or equivalently, the call quality, e.g., data rate, jitter, and packet loss. Such metrics were measured before and after the attack for comparison. The data rate was kept stable after the attack, and omitted for brevity. Figure 12 illustrates the jitter and the packet loss. The jitter was consistently less than 10ms, and the packet loss is mostly kept as zero. Moreover, both were sufficient to support high quality call services [24]. This keeps the SigOver attack stealthy without degrading user experience.",

Specifically, the time required to load multiple identical web pages with and without the attack. Figure 13 presents the results, with ‘HTTP’ representing the total duration of HTTP data exchange for page loading. ‘Signaling’ is the time required for RRC connection establishment. Under the SigOver attack, the time from the RRC connection initiation to the web page downloading is delayed by an average of only 80ms when compared with the case without the attack. Previous studies [12] have shown that the impact of such lag on the quality of the experience is negligible.",

                "FTP downloading. Figure 14 reveals that the FTP exhibited a significantly different performance under the SigOver attack. This is due to dynamically controlled modulation, to overcome the bit error in the communication. The SigOver attack incurs bit errors, which force the UE to use a robust modulation of QPSK, which has a limited throughput. Conversely, without the attack, the bit error is kept low. In this case, the UE used 64QAM which is less robust but supports higher throughput than QPSK. However, this impact is less likely to be experienced by the users and FTP rarely used on smartphones.",
