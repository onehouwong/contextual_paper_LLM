                "Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is a packet-based telephony service seamlessly integrated into the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard and deployed by most telecommunication providers in practice. Due to this widespread use, successful attacks against VoLTE can affect a large number of users worldwide. In this work, we introduce REVOLTE, an attack that exploits an LTE implementation flaw to recover the contents of an encrypted VoLTE call, hence enabling an adversary to eavesdrop on phone calls. REVOLTE makes use of a predictable keystream reuse on the radio layer that allows an adversary to decrypt a recorded call with minimal resources. Through a series of preliminary as well as real-world experiments, we successfully demonstrate the feasibility of REVOLTE and analyze various factors that critically influence our attack in commercial networks. For mitigating the REVOLTE attack, we propose and discuss short- and long-term countermeasures deployable by providers and equipment vendors."

                "Millions of people worldwide use the latest widely deployed mobile communication standard LTE daily. Besides highspeed Internet access, LTE also provides the packet-based telephony service VoLTE. VoLTE promises low call-setup times and high-definition voice quality while being seamlessly integrated into the standard call procedure. With more than 120 providers worldwide and over 1200 different device types supporting VoLTE [23], it is an essential part of our communication infrastructure. At the same time, the use of VoLTE is fully transparent to the user and improves the call quality without requiring any further interaction. Consequently, any practical vulnerability in the VoLTE standard has far-reaching consequences for users all over the world, without them even realizing that they may be affected.",
                "LTE not only improves the performance of prior mobile network generations, but it also defines a series of fundamental security aims to protect further the sensitive information of phone calls, web browsing, etc. One crucial aspect of these security aims is providing data confidentiality [8] for all voice calls, which protects LTE communication from eavesdropping. This is achieved by implementing publicly reviewed encryption algorithms like AES that protect the radio-layer transmission. In addition, VoLTE can establish an additional layer of security that further protects all signaling messages (IPsec tunnel) and voice data (SRTP). We will later see how these additional security features must be considered in the design of our attack. Breaking these protection mechanisms and thus the data confidentiality of LTE, allows us to recover the information of an arbitrary phone call. In a setting where the underlying mobile network generation promises strong security aims, this might reveal highly sensitive information that was assumed to be protected.",
                "While prior work demonstrates that the aims of location and identity privacy [13,43] and an attacker can break the integrity of user data [38], a technical report by Raza and Lu [36] recently indicated that the data confidentiality of LTE might contain a fundamental flaw. By jamming particular messages and reinstalling a key, the authors introduce a concept that theoretically allows eavesdropping on a VoLTE connection. Although their work presents the foundation for breaking the essential security aim—data confidentiality—of the LTE communication standard, their work only covers a theoretical evaluation of the attack vector. It lacks any evidence that the concept is actually feasible in a real-world setup and at a sufficiently large scale.",
                "In this work, we build upon the concept of key reinstallation and break the data confidentiality aim of LTE in a commercial network setup. This attack vector is the starting point for REVOLTE: An attack concept that uses a passive downlink sniffer instead of active jamming, and provides insights on numerous adjustments to the technical requirements and challenges of a real-world implementation of the attack. REVOLTE is a layer-two attack that allows us to Reuse Encrypted VoLTE traffic to eavesdrop on an encrypted voice call. Keystream reuse can occur when two calls are made within one radio connection.",
                "Consequently, an attacker can decrypt the first call when she instantly calls the victim after the first call ended. Even though the specification states that the network is in charge of preventing such key reuse, we find multiple networks reusing the same keystream for subsequent calls. In addition to proving the general feasibility in commercial networks, we further provide an extensive experimental evaluation of all technical and operational requirements that allows us to understand the attack vector better.",
                "With millions of users potentially being at risk, we argue that it is crucial to analyze LTE key reuse attacks beyond their theoretical concept. By developing a better understanding of the open attack vectors in our current mobile network generations, we can avoid the same issues in the specification and implementation of upcoming standards. With that said, we can find the same attack vector in the upcoming 5G networks. Therefore, we additionally take a defensive perspective to analyze and discuss short- and long-term countermeasure concepts that protect from or circumvent the threat of REVOLTE. In summary, our contributions are as follows:",
                "• Attack with Real-World Impact. We analyze keystream reuse under real-world considerations and present a practical attack called REVOLTE. REVOLTE completely breaks the confidentiality aim of LTE and allows an attacker to eavesdrop phone calls.",
                "• Preliminary and Real-World Experiments. We conduct several preliminary experiments to evaluate the various conditions that influence REVOLTE. In particular, we conduct real-world experiments with three operators on keystream reuse and find two of them vulnerable. Further, we assess the use of so-called comfort noise, transcoding, and robust header compression.",
                "• Discussion of Countermeasures. Our experimental evaluation of REVOLTE provides clear evidence that the confidentiality aim of LTE is at risk. We thoroughly discuss potential mitigations that can be deployed by the providers and elaborate on how users can protect themselves.",
                "Disclosure Process. The keystream reuse vulnerability exploited by REVOLTE is an implementation flaw and affects a large number of deployments. Following the guidelines of responsible disclosure, we have reported the vulnerability via the GSMA CVD program (CVD-2019-0030) and actively work together to fix the problem."

To this end, VoLTE uses modified Internet domain protocols: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to signal the call flow, the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to transport the actual voice data, and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) to control the RTP connection. REVOLTE enables an attacker to decrypt the encrypted payload of the RTP packets. In a VoLTE setting, these protocol messages are treated as user data with special transmission requirements. Two important characteristics, the multimedia codecs and robust header compression, influence the way data is transmitted in a VoLTE call. Furthermore, the concept of data bearers allows matching the specific transmission requirements of VoLTE calls."

The technical characteristics of a codec depend on its main goal and can either optimize the data consumption or the perceived call quality (maximizing both would be optimal but unrealistic). Once translated into the target representation, VoLTE uses RTP to transmit data in packets. There are three possible codec options for a VoLTE call: Enhanced Voice Services (EVS), Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR), and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB).",
                "All three codecs are optimized to save bitrate in periods where one calling partner is silent. In these periods, comfort noise is generated based on a transmitted seed sent by the silent calling partner. Comfort noise saves bitrate as the seed is smaller and transmitted on a lower frequency. For example, the AMR-WB codec encodes the seed of the comfort noise with 40 bit every 160 ms. Actual voice is encoded with 477 bit every 20 ms in the high-quality mode (23.85 kbit/s) [5].",
                "Transcoding converts the voice data with a particular codec sent by one calling partner into another codec that is sent to the other calling partner. Although this results in the same audio content (i. e., what the calling partner hears), it destroys the bit pattern of the encoded voice data. Transcoding can happen when the call is routed via an IP exchange (IPX) or when radio-layer problems enforce a downsampling."

Furthermore, compression becomes possible through the possibility of predicting parts of the information across protocols.",

Table 1 provides an exemplary overview of the bearers used for a radio connection. The default bearer (DRB1) transmits the Internet data. A second data bearer (DRB2) is used for the SIP signaling traffic sent to the IMS. In case of a phone call, a third (dedicated) data bearer transports the voice traffic. This bearer is only established for the phone call and is immediately removed after the call. The eNodeB selects the used bearer ID and, thus, depends on the implementation. REVOLTE targets the dedicated voice bearer and exploits the fact that the same bearer ID (DRB3) is reused for a second call within the same radio connection."

Before the actual call takes place, the victim’s UE establishes a connection with the eNodeB in its radio cell, which uses the two default bearers DRB1 and DRB2 for an Internet and an IMS connection. The security mode command generates a new user-plane key and activates the encryption for all data bearers; the user-plane key remains valid for the entire radio connection.",
                "After this preliminary procedure, a standard VoLTE call establishment works as follows. SIP messages establish the call between the victim and the IMS (2a.), and the IMS forwards the call to the calling partner (2b.). Note that for REVOLTE it does not make a difference whether it is an incoming or outgoing call, as the call establishment procedure is the same in both cases. Besides the two standard bearers of the radio connection establishment (1.), the VoLTE connection requires a third dedicated bearer that transports the voice data between the eNodeB and the UE (3.). This dedicated bearer DRB3 transports the RTP data (4.), i. e., it provides the data relevant for the REVOLTE attack. When the phone call ends, the dedicated bearer DRB3 is removed again (5.).",
                "The adversary monitors the target call by placing a downlink sniffer in the same radio cell that the victim’s UE connects to. We explain later how an attacker can decode the sniffed data up to the encrypted PDCP layer (Section 3.4.1).",
                "Keystream Call. The adversary uses the downlink sniffer to detect the end of the target call, i. e., when no more data occurs on DRB3. In response, she initiates the keystream call, where the attacker’s UE dials the victim’s UE (6.). Again, we see the same call setup procedure as for the target call (2. and 3.). At this point, one crucial thing happens: The second VoLTE call requires another dedicated bearer DBR3 to transport the voice data (7.). Since the subsequent keystream call occurs directly after the initial target call and uses the same radio connection, the count for the dedicated bearer resets, and all input parameters are the same as in the target call. As this results in the same keystream, all RTP data (8.) is encrypted in the same way as the voice data of the target call. As soon as a sufficient amount of keystream data was generated, the adversary cancels the call (9.).",

At this point, we emphasize two fundamental differences to the keystream reuse introduced previously in the technical report by Raza and Lu [36] that help to create a more realistic attack setup and procedure. First, we do not depend on jamming, i. e., we do not actively interfere with the transmission spectrum of the providers, but only use a passive downlink sniffer that does not change the transmissions of the radio cell. Second, the downlink sniffer allows recognizing the beginning and end of the target call, which allows initiating the keystream call immediately afterward."

When the UE receives such a reconfiguration message for adding a data bearer, it adds a new PDCP entity and configures it with the current security configuration [10][5.3.10.3]. A new PDCP entity causes a reset of the count variable. More precisely, the hyper frame number and the sequence numbers are set to 0 [6][7.1].

Based on the next hop chaining counter (NNC), which is sent in an RRC Reconfiguration message, the old key (k enb) and a new key (k enb) are derived. As the input material differs from the one used before, the keystream reuse is mitigated. However, using an intra-cell handover comes with the cost of an additional run of the key derivation function.",
                "Switching between RRC Idle/Connected. Another possibility suggested by the specification is to switch back and forth between the RRC connected and RRC idle states, which can be achieved by the RRC connection release and the RRC connection establishment. The eNodeB sends the phone into RRC idle mode with RRC connection release. The phone then triggers an RRC connection establishment, as it needs to send data to the network. A new key for the radio connection is established when the RRC establishment carries an uplink NAS message, which increases the uplink NAS count. Again, this derives a new key (k enb), which is then used for the connection. In general, most RRC connection establishment procedures carry a NAS uplink message. Thus this procedure helps to mitigate the threat. However, sending the phone to idle mode does increase the latency, which should be avoided for the VoLTE calls."

Prior work demonstrates that matching a public identifier with an internal network identity is feasible in mobile networks, e. g., Shaik et al. [43] demonstrate that is is possible to map the phone number to the TMSI. Further, Jover [27] and Kohls et al. [30, 38] show how an uplink or downlink sniffer can match the TMSI to the RNTI.

While we can demonstrate the technical feasibility of REVOLTE in different real-world setups and discuss their challenges, user interaction remains one mandatory factor of the operational aspects of the attack. In general, we can structure this user interaction in three steps:",
                "1) Recognize Incoming Call. This step is rather simple, but still decides whether the attack can be successful. For answering the keystream call, the victim must recognize the call. We can assume that the victim is in the proximity of the phone and thus recognizes the incoming call as he just hang up the previous call.",
                "2) Answer Call. The likelihood to answer the incoming call depends on human factors. For example, answering the phone depends on the caller identity [16]. If the caller identity is known or fits a particular pattern, e. g., area code, we can assume that it is likely that the call gets answered. The adversary can influence this by identity spoofing, which is a common attack in telephony networks [18]. Identity spoofing can exploit a variety of different attack vectors based on SS7 [42] or SIP spoofing [28, 46]. We argue that an attacker who is capable of performing such an attack can increase the likelihood that the victim answers the incoming call. Note that SS7 identity spoofing requires additional capabilities for an attacker, i. e., SS7 network access. In contrast, SIP spoofing does not require additional capabilities as only the attacker’s phone must be manipulated.",
                "3) Hold Call. To generate sufficient keystream material for the final decryption, the keystream call must be as long as the initial target call. Therefore, the adversary must keep up the conversation with the victim for a certain amount of time, depending on the recorded target call. In the context of telephony fraud, different techniques on the basis of social engineering exist, e. g., scam and robocalls are a well-known problem [18, 32, 40]. Besides these rather simple approaches, more advanced techniques use artificial intelligence to impersonate the known voice of a specific person [44]. Obviously, there is a wide range of different options to keep up the malicious keystream for the required amount of time.",
                "Conclusion: User Interaction. Even though REVOLTE depends on user interaction—a factor we cannot influence despite an elaborate and successful technical attack concept—a large body of prior work indicates that we can assume a sufficient rate of “collaboration”. To further increase the chances of a successful attack, the adversary can influence individual factors that motivate users more to answer and hold an incoming call. Overall, we conclude that user interaction is a critical but manageable aspect of REVOLTE."

Furthermore, as one core component of the attack, we outline existing options to record the traffic of an LTE radio cell.",
                "Key Reinstallation Attacks. In 2018, Raza and Lu [36] introduced the theoretical foundation for our work. In their technical report, the authors examine key reinstallation attacks on the LTE control and user plane with an active radio attacker. Such key reinstallation attacks enable an adversary to deny the service for a user by either hijacking the location update or the deregister procedure. As part of their work, they discovered that keys are reused for user plane traffic in case of two subsequent VoLTE calls of one radio connection.",
                "In contrast to their work, we make use of the keystream reuse to fully decrypt the call of a victim that we previously recorded. On the one hand, this requires a much more elaborate attack concept that is capable of countering all technical challenges implied by the protocol and transmission characteristics of VoLTE. By taking this into account, we manage to successfully conduct the attack in different commercial networks and with realistic voice signals in the calls. Our attack is feasible with a passive radio sniffer and a normal phone. On the other hand, our practical evaluation of different networks and attack scenarios allows us to provide an in-depth discussion of the attack vector. Furthermore, we discuss possible short- and long-term defenses against such a critical security and privacy threat.",
                "Overall, we emphasize the importance of a practical perspective in this context, as otherwise neither the impact of the attack for our communication infrastructures nor the consequences for future mobile generations become accessible for future research.",
                "Specification Flaws. In the context of radio layer vulnerabilities, Rupprecht et al. demonstrated that missing integrity protection of user plane data allows an active attacker to redirect a victim to a malicious website or even to impersonate a user towards the network and vice versa [38, 39]. The presented ALTER attack breaks the mutual authentication aim and, eventually, also affects the confidentially aim, as all subsequent DNS and TCP traffic can be intercepted. While ALTER and REVOLTE both highlight flaws on the layer two of the protocol stack, ALTER uses a more restrictive attacker model that depends on an active Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) adversary. In contrast, REVOLTE invades the privacy of VoLTE calls solely depending on passive downlink sniffing.",
                "Further exploits of specification flaws focus on location and identity privacy and manage to localize a victim either using an active or passive attacker model [26,27,37,43]. In the context of REVOLTE, we can use such attacks for verifying if a victim is in the proximity of the attacker, which provides certainty about the success chances of a targeted attack. Another direction of research is the formal verification of the LTE specification. Hussain et al. [25] introduce a symbolic model that is capable of checking critical LTE procedures; by applying their tool, they have identified different flaws that allows for denial of service or relay attacks. Basin et al. [13] and Cremers et al. [19] use a Tamarin prover to analyze the 5G AKA, which is comparable to the LTE AKA. While such work demonstrates the general security of the AKA, REVOLTE exploits the keystream reuse after the initial AKA.",
                "Implementation and Configuration Flaws. While specification flaws introduce security issues in the foundations of LTE, implementation flaws are examples of an insecure realization of the specification. Kim et al. [29] propose the tool LTEFuzz, which allows to find vulnerabilities in different LTE implementations. Furthermore, configuration flaws introduce vulnerabilities in cases where providers setup network parameters in an insecure way. Chlosta et al. [17] analyze multiple network configurations and find configuration flaws that enable an adversary to impersonate a victim to the network.",
                "LTE Cryptography. LTE (gen. four) encrypts radio transmissions with secure encryption algorithms, e. g., AES. In contrast, the second generation (GSM) specifies three encryption algorithms, two of which have been broken in the meantime, which allows a passive adversary to eavesdrop phone calls. The A5/2 algorithm is purposely weak and already prohibited to use [12, 22, 33]; the stronger but still insufficient algorithm A5/1 can be broken by consumer hardware and rainbow tables [14,20,41]. In scenarios where the phone or the provider does not support VoLTE, GSM calls are still used and in case of A5/1 encryption, the call can be eavesdropped.",

Our attack builds upon a previously introduced keystream reuse and extends it with an elaborate attack concept that enables eavesdropping attacks in real-world commercial networks. In a series of preliminary experiments, we analyze the different protocol and transmission characteristics of VoLTE and provide an in-depth evaluation of network configurations. Based on these insights, we conduct the REVOLTE attack in a commercial network with a setup that costs less than 7000 $. Our results emphasize the need for short-term solutions that avoid the exploitation in current mobile generations and long-term solutions that help to provide data confidentiality for upcoming generations that currently indicate the same vulnerability.",
